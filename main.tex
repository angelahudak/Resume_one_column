\smallskip
    \begin{tightlist}
    \item Worked in a remote setting with a Software Engineering Team.
    \item Designed and developed the backend that would allow the user to store and analyze data using Python and the Pandas library.
    \item The application was able to receive data from a csv file and would automate the organization of it so it could be easily viewed by the user.
    \item Learned C++ to develop smaller applications which could potentially be used in upcoming projects.

\combosection{MIPS Project}{VHDL}{January 2021 - May 2021}{}
\smallskip
    \begin{tightlist}
        \item This project was completed over the course of my Digital System Design 2 class.
        \item Used Xilinx Vivado to create the functional parts of a MIPS Processor.
        \item The parts that were included in the processor were ALU, Register File, Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback Stages.
        \item The processor was able to receive different MIPS assembly instructions and execute those commands.

\vspace{\topsep}
    \begin{tightlist}
        \item A game developed for the Atari 2600 using the 6502 Assembly architecture.
        \item Learned how to create sprites and digits on playing field using assembly commands.
        \item The game contains a multitude of features such as a play field, scoreboard, missiles, two players on the screen at a time, warp border to the left and right, and background sound.
